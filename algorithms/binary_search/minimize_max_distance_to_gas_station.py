# Minimize Max Distance to Gas Station
# On a horizontal number line, we have gas stations at positions stations[0],
# stations[1], ..., stations[N-1], where N = stations.length.
# Now, we add K more gas stations so that D, the maximum distance between adjacent gas stations, is minimized.
# Return the smallest possible value of D.
# Note:
# 1. 10 <= stations.length <= 2000, stations[i] will be an integer
# 2. 1 <= K <= 1e6
# 3. answers within 10^-6 of the true value will be accepted as correct
#
# Intuition:
# with K gas stations, can we make every adjacent distance between gas stations at most D?
# Specific:
# with D' being a possible answer, for each interval with W = stations[i+1] - stations[i]
# W / D' stations are needed to ensure every subinterval has size less than Dâ€˜
